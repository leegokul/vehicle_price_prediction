# Vehicle Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This is an end-to-end Machine Learning project to predict the selling price of used vehicles based on their specifications. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment through a Streamlit web application.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project helps users estimate the selling price of a used vehicle using machine learning techniques. Key processes involve:

* Data cleaning & preprocessing
* Feature engineering
* Model training and validation
* Saving the model as `model.pkl`
* Building a web interface using Streamlit

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Streamlit
* Pickle

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

* Regression model to predict vehicle prices
* Trained using a dataset containing vehicle attributes:

  * Vehicle name
  * Manufacturing year
  * Fuel type
  * Transmission type
  * Owner history
  * KM driven
  * Seller type

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### **1️⃣ Install Requirements**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **2️⃣ Run Streamlit App**

```
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 📦 Dataset

Dataset includes features such as:

* Name
* Year
* KM Driven
* Fuel Type
* Seller Type
* Transmission
* Owner
* Selling Price (Target)

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a predictive model that estimates used vehicle prices accurately and provide a web interface for user input.

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

* Deploy online (Render / Huggingface / Railway)
* Add more features (engine power, mileage, location)
* Improve UI/UX
* Try other ML models & hyperparameter tuning
