# Vehicle Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This is an end-to-end Machine Learning project to predict the selling price of used vehicles based on their specifications. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment through a Streamlit web application.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project helps users estimate the selling price of a used vehicle using machine learning techniques. Key processes involve:

* Data cleaning & preprocessing
* Feature engineering
* Model training and validation
* Saving the model as `model.pkl`
* Building a web interface using Streamlit
